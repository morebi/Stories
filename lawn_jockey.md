+ LAWN JOCKEY
```

Lemrick set fire to the lawn clippings. He bathed in the glow of the incinerator, not minding the extra heat. The day was sweltering. A sickly blue sky hung over Lemrick&#39;s head and the red sun beat down relentlessly. The incinerator, an industrial-grade MK7-HOSS, still had that new smell of fresh PlastiCoating. Lemrick loved the incinerators and was delighted that the lords had purchased a new one. The familiar smell of burnt chlorophyll and rotting biomass filled the air.


Every day, Lemrick incinerated the clippings. As a MESTIZO class sub-overseer, Lemrick&#39;s position wasn&#39;t all management, and he was required to perform several menial duties, including incineration. Lemrick didn&#39;t mind. The joyous flames of the beast called to him. He could stare for hours at the dancing lights. Lemrick felt the most at peace while quietly stoking the embers and watching the grass melt. Knowing this, Lemrick&#39;s innermost dream might not come as such a surprise. Despite having grown up as a lawn jockey, Lemrick had always aspired to work the grill. Lemrick&#39;s father, grandfather, and great-grandfather were all renowned lawn jockeys. In a way, Lemrick had been born for the lawn. He learned the various varieties of grasses and their aspects from a young age and had an instinctual knack for inspection, always being able to determine correct grass height and thickness by eye. Nonetheless, the fire had always beckoned Lemrick. In his dreams, he cooked the lords&#39; kielbasas, wieners, dogs, sausages, brats, bangers, franks, and tube steaks, listening in rapture to the hot snap of grease as meat charred on the coals.


&quot;Yo fag, quit daydreaming. The lords want to see you.&quot;  
&quot;What are you fucking serious? I haven&#39;t done anything. I did that reconditioning two weeks ago.&quot; Lemrick replied.  
&quot;Yeah, don&#39;t know what it&#39;s about. Probably nothing. Sure as hell glad it&#39;s not me going up there though.&quot; said Imani, the MULATTO class dom-overseer of Sector 8 and Lemrick&#39;s supervisor.

Lemrick swore under his breath and turned to walk towards the manor. Sector 8 was the second largest sector on the estate and it usually took Lemrick 27 minutes to walk from the sector&#39;s edge to the manor. Lemrick dreaded facing the lords though, and found himself at the manor&#39;s main door an hour and a half later. Before Lemrick had time to knock, the 12-foot ebony doors swung open. Adorned with gold and ivory, the doors were truly breathtaking and caused all guests to pause for a moment before entering. The doors opened to reveal Zemwe (Master of the House – [BLACK]).

&quot;Lemrick… We&#39;ve been expecting you for some time now.&quot;  
&quot;I apologize sir. The lawns prove challenging today.&quot;  
&quot;I&#39;m sure it&#39;s nothing you can&#39;t handle. Come, Jorge is expecting you.&quot;

Zemwe, as always, was clad head to toe in black latex. Only his eyes, mouth and genitals were exposed. Lemrick averted his eyes from Zemwe&#39;s perpetually erect cock and walked towards the Hall of Entertainment.

&quot;He&#39;ll see you in the Cathedral of Pleasure.&quot;

Lemrick took one of the first doors in the hall and entered the cathedral. The Cathedral of Pleasure was an especially extravagant display of wealth and easily the most expensive room in the manor. Imported from France, the lords had had the original dismantled, transported, and then restored on the estate. Priceless jewels and artifacts decorated the walls. Jorge lay lounging on a couch bathed in the colored light of a stained glass window. Surrounding him were four twinks, all in various stages of intoxication. The lords did not entertain guests on weekdays, otherwise the cathedral would have been filled to capacity.

&quot;Ah, Lemrick, how pleasant to see you.&quot; Jorge tittered.  
&quot;My lord.&quot;  
&quot;Cheer up boy. You aren&#39;t here to be punished. As I recall, your reconditioning went splendidly.&quot;  
&quot;Quite right sir.&quot;  
&quot;No, no dear Lemrick. I summoned you here today because we have noticed a little, how should I say, decrease in your mood.&quot;  
&quot;I&#39;m not sure I understand.&quot;  
&quot;Well, as you know, we want all our devoted employees to enjoy themselves above all. It wouldn&#39;t do for a worker to be down in the dumps day after day would it? This is a house of sensate pleasure after all.&quot;  
&quot;Of course sir.&quot;  
&quot;Splendid! Splendid! I knew you would understand. So if you could just try to have a little more fun, you know. Don&#39;t be such a frowny face.&quot;  
&quot;I&#39;ll do my best my lord.&quot;  
&quot;Good, good. Lemrick, your family has served us for generations and that will never be forgotten. I must confess that we consider you a kind of faggot to us. Don&#39;t you consider us faggots to you?&quot;  
&quot;I do my lord.&quot;  
&quot;Brilliant! Lemrick, dear boy, I&#39;m so glad we had this little chance to chat. In fact, why don&#39;t you take a swim in the pool for the rest of the afternoon? Take your mind of things.&quot;  
&quot;If it pleases my lord.&quot;  
&quot;Call it a special occasion. You can even use the main pool.&quot;  
&quot;My lord is too kind.&quot;

Lemrick left the cathedral and went to the main pool. The servant pool was a gutter compared to the main pool. A simple concrete square cut into the ground, the servant pool contained a mild cocktail of trihalomethanes, opiates, and sedatives that, when absorbed through a swimmer&#39;s skin, induced a relaxed state. Purely functional, the servant pool only existed to improve worker efficiency. The main pool, however, was lavish. The size of a large pond, bordering on a lake, the main pool could easily accommodate a hundred or more. As for the narcotics, no expense had been spared. A child could have gotten high with just a toe in the water. The water contained a potent mix of the latest designer drugs, opiates, amphetamines, cathinodrones, alkylphrines, dexylphrines, and flurobutyldrones. Uppers, downers, hallucinogens, and dissassociatives - any and every type of drug had been mixed to provide a transcendent high.

Personally, Lemrick didn&#39;t enjoy the pools. He didn&#39;t like the way they affected his mind, and his body felt strange while under the drugs&#39; influence. In fact, Lemrick&#39;s recent incident, which caused the need for reconditioning, had been the result of too much pool time. After falling asleep in the servant pool, Lemrick had awoken in a hallucinogenic frenzy and proceeded to go on a rampage. Reportedly, Lemrick had attacked his chief lieutenant Gretige (1st Lieutenant of the Lawn – [QUADROON]), beaten him unconscious, and dragged him to the incinerator. Witnesses stated Lemrick drew strange lines on Gretige&#39;s chest before throwing his body in the inferno. The incinerator, while able to handle military-grade weeds and debris, was no match for a 5&#39;2&quot; human carcass and had to be replaced. After reconditioning, Lemrick remembered none of this save for nightmares of screaming and fire.

Despite disliking the pools, Lemrick didn&#39;t dare disobey Jorge. Although a bottom, Jorge had a much more aggressive temperament than this husband Rupal. Horror stories were told throughout the lawn of disobedient workers being trapped in the Cathedral of Pain for weeks on end. With Rupal out of town on business and Jorge in charge, Lemrick kept on his best behavior.

Descending into the pool, Lemrick felt the rush of neurochemical release. He felt pleasure he had never experienced before. His body was heaven. He was God. Time dissolved. The Veil of Maya dropped away and Lemrick embraced the wicked joy of hell. As a result of his impermanent nirvana, every muscle in Lemrick&#39;s body relaxed. Not being used to the pool, Lemrick didn&#39;t have the foresight to empty his bladder before swimming. A pale yellow cloud spread throughout the water.

Jorge, who had been coming to check on Lemrick, arrived just in time to view the cloud of piss.  
&quot;WHAT ARE YOU DOING?&quot;  
The words shattered Lemrick&#39;s trance.  
&quot;M- My Lord. Forgive me. I did not wish… This is a mere accident I swear.&quot; Lemrick stammered.  
&quot;Bet&quot; Jorge snapped, his forehead turning nearly purple, veins straining on either side of his head.  
Jorge was visibly shaking, but he suddenly grew still and his face relaxed into a gentle smile.  
&quot;What am I saying? Of course it&#39;s not your fault. You just aren&#39;t used to the main pool.&quot;  
&quot;Lemrick,&quot; Jorge went on. &quot;I actually came here to discuss a new position for you. You see, during reconditioning, you mentioned that perhaps you might enjoy working the grill.&quot;  
&quot;My lord, I don&#39;t remember… Surely I-&quot;  
&quot;Lemrick it&#39;s quite alright. In fact, a new position has become available. Apprentice to the Master of the Grill. Would that interest you?&quot;  
&quot;My lord. I can&#39;t express my gratitude. This a dream realized.&quot;  
&quot;Perfect. You will report to Jiro first thing tomorrow.&quot;  

Lemrick could barely contain himself. &quot;Apprentice of the Grill&quot;, he thought. Lemrick had always known the impossibility of his dreams, and only a hidden portion of his mind had ever expected them to come true. Lemrick lay awake in bed that night, his thoughts filled with grilling, hardly able to sleep.

The next day, Lemrick awoke early and made his way to the grilling complex attached to the manor. Jiro (Master of the Grill – [BLACK]) was already present, cutting precise sections of meat from a large slab.

&quot;Lemrick?&quot;  
&quot;Good morning sir.&quot;  
&quot;Hm, we need to get you up to speed quickly. Master Rupal will be returning tonight and the lords have requested sausages. I know it&#39;s your first day, but I&#39;m putting you in charge of the brats, since they&#39;re easy. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll make sure you don&#39;t fuck it up.&quot;  
&quot;I&#39;ll do my best sir.&quot;  
&quot;You&#39;ll do it right, how about that?&quot;  

Jiro gave Lemrick a crash course, explaining the different types of meat and grilling techniques. Lemrick struggled at first, but his resolve never faltered. It took multiple unsuccessful tries, but eventually, with Jiro&#39;s help, Lemrick cooked a brat perfectly. Inside fully cooked, outside charred just enough, the simple gleaming brat was the most beautiful thing Lemrick had ever seen.

&quot;Not too bad. Just in time too. Dinner&#39;s about to start.&quot;  
Jiro expertly sliced the brat and arranged it on a serving dish with a simple garnish. Lemrick followed Jiro as he delivered the dish to the head table where Rupal and Jorge dined.  
&quot;Ah, our new Apprentice of the Grill.&quot; Rupal exclaimed, &quot;How delightful.&quot;  
&quot;Isn&#39;t it?&quot; said Jorge, &quot;I knew how much Lemrick dreamed of attending the grill and thought it would be a wonderful change of pace.&quot;  
Lemrick beamed with pride as a servant distributed slices of brat to the lords. Jorge impaled one slice and brought it to his mouth. He had scarcely touched the meat to his tongue when his face contorted in revulsion.  
&quot;AHH&quot;  
Jorge threw his fork down and spat out the slice of brat.  
&quot;What in the fuck is this shit?&quot;  
Lemrick stood in stunned silence.  
&quot;You deaf hunh? I asked you what in the fuck is this shit?&quot; Jorge clapped.  
&quot;Please sir, I&#39;ve toiled since dawn for this dish.&quot; Lemrick pleaded.  
Jiro said nothing.  
&quot;My lord?&quot; Lemrick turned to Rupal.  
&quot;You heard my husband, jockey, this brat is vile.&quot;  
&quot;This shit trash boo.&quot; Jorge sneered.  
&quot;You ain&#39;t got nothing to say? Nah? Speak up bitch!&quot; Jorge&#39;s voice grew louder. &quot;That&#39;ll teach you. You fucking jockey. You fucking VIRGIN! Teach you to fucking piss in my goddamn pool. You&#39;ll NEVER be a grill master. You&#39;re garbage. You&#39;ll never touch a grill again in your life v-boy. You thought a fucking lawn jockey could master the grill? HA!&quot;

Lemrick should have known. As a feminine gay bitch type, Jorge would never forget or forgive a transgression. Lemrick realized he had been made a fool, humiliated by Jorge&#39;s ruse. Hot tears streamed down his cheeks. Lemrick ran out of the room, utterly destroyed.

&quot;Ya bye. BYE.&quot; Jorge called behind him.

Lemrick didn&#39;t stop running until he reached Sector 8. He collapsed on the expertly maintained grass. The ground was familiar, and Lemrick wept until stars crossed the sky and his sorrow turned to stone. His thoughts were cold. &quot;Why do the lords decide my life?&quot; His future was clear. The fire beckoned. It was time to burn.

Lemrick left the Lawn Armory carrying a bag and an MX-LazerRake. He walked directly to the manor&#39;s entrance. As always, the doors swung open just as he arrived, revealing Zemwe.  
&quot;We&#39;re not expecting y-&quot;  
Zemwe&#39;s words were cut short as Lemrick thrust the LazerRake at his throat. The 450nm beam felt almost no resistance as it bisected Zemwe&#39;s neck flesh. The rake cauterized Zemwe&#39;s head stump instantly, and the now disembodied appendage rolled and fell to the floor. Lemrick pushed pass the corpse into the hall. He made his way through the labyrinth of corridors to the grilling complex. The few servants he encountered ran at the sight of him. A scream came from inside the manor. Lemrick activated the main grill and opened his bag. The bag contained mostly lawn clippings but also an explosive mixture of fertilizer and lawn chemicals. Lemrick added a gallon of Grilfule ® and poured the bag&#39;s contents onto the grill. Jorge stumbled out into the complex.

&quot;Who the fuck do you think you are? You fucking killed Zemwe?! Are you listening you jockey virgin piece of shit? I own your ass.&quot; Jorge yelled.

Lemrick set fire to the lawn clippings. His body vanished in flames. The conflagration consumed the manor in seconds. Buildings were washed away. The fire raged, devouring the immaculate grass. Sectors of the Lawn were destroyed by waves of inferno. The estate burned and flames rose to touch the sky.
